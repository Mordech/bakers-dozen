# Baker's Dozen App

A baking calculator app for baking 🍞, 🍕, and 🥨.

## Disclaimer

This is my first Expo app, and my first Javascript project. Use it at you own risk 😅.
I used this project to learn the basics of Javascript, React and Redux.

The recepies in this app are converted to percentages from a bunch of recepies and my basic knowladge of baking. <br>
If you run into problems with the recepies you're more than invited to contact me.
