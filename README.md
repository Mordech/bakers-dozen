# Baker's Dozen App

Baker's Dozen is a calculator app for baking bread, pizza, and pretzel.

## Disclaimer

This app is my first Expo app and my first Javascript project. Use it at your own risk 😅.
I used this project to learn the basics of Javascript, React, and Redux.

I converted the recipes to percentages from a bunch of recipes and my basic knowledge of baking. <br>
If you run into problems with the recipes, please contact me.
